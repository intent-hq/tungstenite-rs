# INTENT-HQ FORK — Maintenance

This is [intent-hq](https://github.com/intent-hq)'s fork of
[snapview/tungstenite-rs](https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs). This document is
the fork's maintenance policy. Everything fork-specific in the tree is marked
`INTENT-HQ FORK`.

## What the fork carries

The `deflate` branch carries, on top of upstream:

- **permessage-deflate (RFC 7692)** — compression/decompression, extension header
  parsing and negotiation, protocol wiring, and message-size enforcement during
  decompression, behind an off-by-default `deflate` feature.
- **`negotiate_offers`** — a public server-side extension negotiation API
  (`src/extensions/mod.rs`), so servers embedding tungstenite can negotiate
  extension offers themselves.
- **CI additions** — clippy job, all-features tests, gated/summarized Autobahn
  reports, and the `upstream-sync.yml` automation described below.

## Branch layout

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `deflate` | **Default branch.** Upstream + the fork delta. What consumers pin. Never pushed to by automation. |
| `master` | Pristine mirror of upstream `master`. No fork commits. |
| `sync/upstream-<date>` | Integration branches created by the upstream-sync workflow. Disposable. |

`deflate` is the default branch so that scheduled workflows (which only fire from the
default branch) run against the fork's real code.

## Upstream sync automation

`.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` runs weekly (and via `workflow_dispatch`). It:

1. Fetches upstream `master` and the latest upstream release tag (`vX.Y.Z`).
2. Detects whether upstream has commits/releases not yet merged into `deflate`.
3. If so, attempts an automated merge of upstream into `sync/upstream-<date>` and
   reports whether it merged cleanly and whether the gates pass (fmt / clippy /
   test with deflate).

**Notification mechanism: a single draft PR** against `deflate` (opened once, then
refreshed on subsequent runs). Issues are disabled on this fork, so a draft PR is the
chosen surface — it appears in the PR list, notifies watchers, and carries the merge
and gate results in its body. On merge conflicts the integration branch points at
upstream head so GitHub surfaces the conflicts on the PR.

The workflow **never pushes to `deflate`**. A human (or agent) performs the actual
version bump. Note: the draft PR is created with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so
the regular CI workflow does not auto-run on it — the gate results in the PR body
and a manual CI run on the integration branch are the signal.

## Upstream version bump procedure

1. `git fetch upstream --tags` (upstream = `https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs`).
2. Fast-forward `master` to upstream `master` (mirror only, no fork commits).
3. On a branch off `deflate`, `git merge vX.Y.Z` (the upstream **release tag**, not a
   random master commit). Resolve conflicts — the usual hotspots are
   `src/protocol/mod.rs`, `src/handshake/`, and `Cargo.toml`.
4. Adapt the deflate delta to any upstream API changes; keep `INTENT-HQ FORK`
   markers on fork-specific code.
5. Re-run the gates: `cargo +nightly fmt --all --check`,
   `cargo clippy --all --tests --all-features -- -D warnings`,
   `cargo test --release --all-features`, and the **Autobahn** suite
   (`scripts/autobahn-client.sh` / `scripts/autobahn-server.sh` — CI runs these too).
6. Merge to `deflate` (PR or fast-forward) once green.
7. Retag (see below) and update consumers.

## Tagging convention

Fork releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z-deflate.N`, where `vX.Y.Z` is the upstream release
the branch is based on and `N` is a monotonically increasing fork revision on that
base (e.g. `v0.30.0-deflate.1`, `v0.30.0-deflate.2`, `v0.31.0-deflate.1`). Plain
`vX.Y.Z` tags are upstream's — never create fork tags without the `-deflate.N`
suffix.

## Consumers

[intentd](https://github.com/intent-hq/intentd) consumes this fork indirectly through
the [intent-hq/tokio-tungstenite](https://github.com/intent-hq/tokio-tungstenite)
fork (`branch = "deflate"` git dependency) and **pins exact revisions via
`Cargo.lock`** — moving `deflate` never silently changes intentd builds; a bump there
requires a `Cargo.lock` update in intentd.

## Retirement

If upstream lands permessage-deflate support, this fork is retired: consumers move to
the upstream release and the fork is archived. Tracked in
[intent-hq/monorepo#1969](https://github.com/intent-hq/monorepo/issues/1969).
